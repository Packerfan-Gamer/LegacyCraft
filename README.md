# LegacyCraft
LegacyCraft is a mod for NeverEnding Legacy. It is intended as a full expansion of the game, adding capitalism and industry.

LegacyCraft is built on the foundation of my previous mod, "LegacyCOOL", and as such it is not recommended to load both at once, as that will cause errors. LegacyCraft should be compatible with other mods, such as Magix.
